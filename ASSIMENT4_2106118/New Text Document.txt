LA4.1 WAP to print your name 5 times using while loop.
LA4.2 WAP to input any integer and print your name that many times.
LA4.3 WAP to print the series as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ..........100.
LA4.4 WAP to print the series as 1 3 7 15 31 ..........n, where n is given by
 user.
LA4.5 WAP to print the series as 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 ..........n, where n is given 
 user.
LA4.6 WAP to print the series as 3 5 7 11 13 17..........n, where n is given
 by user.
LA4.7 WAP to print all odd and even numbers separately within a given range.The range is input through user.
 
HA4.1 WAP to check whether an input integer is strong number or not.
(Hint: If the sum of factorials of all digits of a number are equal to the 
number are equal to the number, it is called a strong number )
HA4.2 WAP to find out the prime factors of a number entered through keyboard 
(distinct).
/*Hints: A prime number is any number with no divisors other than itself and
 1, such as 2 and 5. Any number can be written as a product of prime numbers
 in a unique way (except for the order). These are called prime factors of a
 number. In other words, In number theory, the prime factors of a positive
 integer are the prime numbers that divide that integer exactly, without 
 leaving a remainder. The process of finding these numbers is called integer
 factorization, or prime factorization. 
 • Enter a number : 100
 • The prime factors of 100 are 2(2) and 5(2)
 • That is, 100 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5, and those numbers are primes. */
